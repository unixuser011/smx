SMX
===

## Systems management program for UNIX/Linux

[![main-menu screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unixuser011/smx/master/screenshots/main-screen.JPG)](#smx-main-screen)


SMX is a general systems administration program for UNIX/Linux/*NIX based systems for user/group, disk, general systems management and server management.
Including Apache, MySQL, Samba, DHCP, DNS, MS Active Directory intergration, etc.

It uses a unique OS detection script that allows the program to guess which version or distrobution of Linux it is running on using various files incling
/proc/version and /etc/redhat-version, it currently support all major distrobutions of Linux including: all red hat versions, all debian versions, all ubuntu
versions, and all SuSE versions, and OS X, with support for knoppix, arch, gentoo and BSD support planned in the near future

COMPARISON BETWEEN SYSTEM MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
=============================================

## Comparison between webmin, chef, cfengine, puppet, spacewalk, and SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager), and SMX, pros and cons of all programs

CHEF
====

[![chef](http://s3.amazonaws.com/opscode-corpsite/assets/121/pic-chef-logo.png)](#chef-logo)

An open-source configuration program written in Ruby using pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuation scripts, also known as
"recipes" that describe how server applications such as Apache, MySQL or Hadoop are to be configured

Pros - Chef does support a wide range of systems including AT&T UNIX, Linux, BSD and Microsoft Windows 
       relitivly easy to setup and use ether in a stand alone configuration or in a client/server configuration

Cons - Since Chef is written in Ruby and uses DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for writing its configutation scripts - it almost requires you to know Ruby,
	   the documentation for it is terrible
	   it expects you to know Chef before using it
	   and the examples try and do everything at once

Comparision:
===========

Chef
----
Supports a wide range of systems from AT&T UNIX, Linux and Windows
Uses Ruby and domain-specific language to create configutation scripts
Works best in client/server mode
Configration engine for chef requires you to know chef before you use it

SMX
---
Supports all major Linux versions, and OS X
Written entirely in Bash, easy to learn and extend the program
Works in standalone and can be used to manage a remote system
Written in portable language and uses non-specific software and uses 
$(which <software>) to get program path

CFENGINE
========

[![CFEngine](http://media.marketwire.com/attachments/201402/227117_cfengine-logo.jpg)](#cfengine-logo)

An open-source configutation manager which is web based and command line based, to provide automated configuration of large-scale systems such as servers, desktops,
imbedded networked devices, and like chef, it too uses configuation scripts to configure how a user were to configure a server or program in its own language, even though, it is very well written, better than chef, and supports a wide range of systems from UNIX and Linux to Windows and in v2 features options for machine learning

Pros - Very well written and designed for a whole slew of systems ranging from small embedded networked devices to corporate servers and desktops
	   offers a web-based interface as a subsutute for the command-line client
	   and has support for machine learning, which no other program (except those created for IBM's Watson) has support for

Cons - It does require some expert knoledge about the OS that CFEngine is being installed on
	   and also with the web-based management console, since its web-based
	   it will suffer from all other web-based programs such as invalid or self-signed SSL certificates, insecure login management, etc

Comparision:
===========

CFEngine
--------
Largly web-based, could suffer from self-signed SSL certs and may cause firewall problems
Like Chef, it uses self-made configuration scripts to perform its tasks
Configuration language has been described as a "programming language without resonable syntax"
Is battle-tested against the most hostile of environments, the college campus network, with users 
up to 50,000 or mor
Does not play well with file integrity checkers such as tripwire

SMX
---
Strictly command-line based, allowing only root user access using id -g 
(will be switching to sudo -v in the future)
Written completely in Bash script, a language that sysadmins allready know
and as such, its a language that is easy to work in

PUPPET
======

[![Puppet](http://www.ammeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/puppet-labs-logo-300x295.png)](#Puppet-logo)

An open-source configuration manager for Linux/UNIX and Windows-based systems written in Ruby and, like chef, it uses a Ruby DSL to create its configuration
scripts, as such it is system-specific and works in a client/server configuration, and requires connection to a main server, also known as the "puppet master"

Pros - Very well written
	   used by many Fortune-500 companies such as Mozilla, CERN, Dell, Oracle, Intel and Google to name a few
        uses a Ruby DSL to create its configration scripts and as such it is a high-level, system-specific language, that allows configuration for multiple 
        systems without having to put in OS specific commands such as rpm, yum and apt

Cons - Like chef, it uses a Ruby DSL to create its configutation scripts, so it almost requires you to know Ruby before you use it
       it requires works in a client/server environment and requires connection to a main server, known as a "puppet master" and if that server goes down you 
       can't configure your systems

Comparision:
===========

Puppet
------
like chef, it uses Ruby DSL to create its configuration scripts, requires knoledge of Ruby
No need for OS specific commands such as rpm, yum and apt 
Requies connection to main server, known as a "puppet master" if this server goes down, system       
conifguatation is impossible

SMX
---
Written purly in Bash, a language that is easy to learn and expand, a language that systadmins know
Uses unique OS detection script to "guess" which OS or distrobution to use
Does not require connection to master server, as each client works independantly of one another

SPACEWALK
=========

[![Spacewalk](http://www.clevernetsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/spacewalk-black.png)](#spacewalk-logo)

An open-source systems management program developed by Red Hat that has a web-based interface and a backend to work with Red Hat satellite and Red Hat Proxy server
to work with RHEL, Solaris, Fedora, CentOS, SuSE and Debian based systems, but requires a Red Hat network account which can cost upwards of Â£2,000 and, like
puppet, it requires a cental server to communicate with, and since its web based, like CFEngine it may suffer from invalid or self-signed SSL certificates
or may require ports to be open in a firewall which can cause problems for sysadmins to justify opening said ports

Pros - Great support for RHEL-based, Debian-based, Ubuntu-based and SuSE-based systems and support for Solaris

Cons - Can't perform tasks such as user admin, disk admin, etc. really is just patch management software that can push out OS updates to registered systems
       no support for OS X, requires connection to main spacewalk server, and like other web-based system management programs, it may suffer from self-signed SSL 
	   certificates

Comparision:
===========

Spacewalk
---------
Requries subscription to Red Hat Network
Requries connection to central spacewalk server, if that system goes down, system config impossible
Doesn't perform tasks such as user, disk and other standard sysadmin tasks, is really patch
management software

SMX
---
Fully open-source, requires no licence, exept GPLv2
Does not require Internet connection or connection to master server, works independantly of each other
Performs all user/group, disk and other sysadmin tasks such as server management

SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager)
==========================================

[![SCCM](http://its.unl.edu/images/sccm-short.png)](#sccm-logo)

Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager is a systems management software platform for Windows, Linux, OS X and UNIX-based systems as well as mobile OS's
such as Android, iOS and Windows Phone, it provides patch management, remote control, software distrobution, OS deployment and network access protection
requires a 64Bit system running Windows server to run the sccm server, it best works in Windows-only envronments working with Active Directory, can't perform
tasks that other systems configuration managers can perform such as user/group management, disk management, etc

Pros - Great support for Windows, working with Active Directory and other Microsoft clients, performing OS deployment, patch management, and software distrobution

Cons - Requries Windows server to use as sccm main server, can work with non-windows clients (Linux, UNIX and the like) but "preferes" to work with Windows clients
       not very poweful - as it only uses a GUI to perform tasks
       and as typical with Microsoft it uses the proprietary model
       so users can't change the product to suit their needs

Comparision:
===========

SCCM
----
Requries Windows server to run management console
Can't perform task that other systems management programs can
Follows proprietary software model

SMX
---
Can be run on any varient of Linux, requres no centeral server
Can perform all user/group, disk and systems/server management tasks
Fully open source, requring acceptance of GPLv2 licence

Webmin
======

[![Webmin](http://www.tecadmin.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/webmin-logo.png)](#webmin-logo)

A web-based system configuration tool for UNIX and Linux systems, used to configure OS internals such as users, disks, services or configuration files, build
around modules, so it is easy to add new functonality, it also allows multiple systems to be controled through one interface, however, since its web based, it
suffers from self-signed SSL certificates and does not use SSL by default, requires the install of the Perl SSL package to use SSL

Pros - Very well written, concidering that it can modify system internals from the web-based interface, expandable because of its module-type setup

Cons - Not very powerfull because it is web-based, does not use SSL by default, requires Perl SSL package to be installed, suffers from self-signed SSL
       certificates

Comparision:
===========

Webmin
------
Web-based allowing modification of system internals, from user and group modifications, to server administration
Suffers from self-signed SSL certificates and does not use SSL by default - requires Perl SSL package
Can't install packages or install servers, requires to have servers allready installed
Program relyes on set paths for programs, can't use some modules because the program, even if it exists, webmin can't find it

SMX
---
Can install packages for Linux and does not requies servers to be installed, as the program will install the program and configure it
Program uses $(which <program>) to get program path
More powerfull because of it being command-line based

SMX (Systems Management eXecutive)
==================================

[![SMX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unixuser011/smx/master/screenshots/main-screen.JPG)](#smx-main-screen)

An open-source systems management program, working with Linux and UNIX based systems using an OS detection script to "guess" which version of Linux the system
is running and run OS specific commands for that system, can perform multple tasks such as user/group management, disk management, general server management,
including server management for Apache, MySQL, Samba, DNS, DHCP, etc

Pros - Easy to learn, use, and extend, witten in Bash, a language that sysadmins allready know and work with, can perform tasks such as user/group modifications,
disk administration, general system administration, and server administration for Apache, MySQL, Samba, DNS, DHCP, etc

Cons - Not fully supported by every linux distrobution (knoppix, arch, gentoo and BSD) but will in a future release
